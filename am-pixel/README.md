## What AM Pixel Is

AM Pixel is a custom-built AI sprite generator for retro pixel art games. It produces original, studio-quality assets through natural language conversation with a character DNA system that enforces perfect visual continuity across an entire project.

It is not a wrapper around any existing image generator. It is a purpose-built autoregressive transformer that generates sprites as sequences of discrete palette-index tokens — the same architecture as a language model, applied to pixel art.

## Seven Generation Modes

| Mode | Name | What It Does |
|------|------|--------------|
| 1 | Character Creation | Text → sprite → DNA lock → full sprite sheet |
| 2 | Sheet Extension | Add animations to existing characters without touching existing sprites |
| 3 / 3b | Tileset & Parallax | Environment tilesets with aesthetic proof; layered parallax battle backgrounds |
| 4 | UI Generation | Curated style options → full UI asset set including icons and title screen |
| 5 | Font Generation | Curated pixel font options → full character set |
| 5b | Prompt Expansion | Optional: expand short descriptions into full character briefs (SNES style-aware) |
| 6 | Battle Effects | Animated spell, impact, and effect sequences for combat |
| 7 | Freeform | Unconstrained generation — any description, any resolution, no DNA, no style bible |

## Quality Standard

Every generated sprite is evaluated before the human sees it.

- **Individual threshold:** 95/100 on the evaluation rubric — below 95 means rebuild, not patch
- **Production threshold:** 99 out of 100 sprites in a validation batch must each independently score 95+ — this is a batch pass rate, NOT a score of 99 points

---

## On Speed vs. Accuracy — A Design Position Statement

**This project does not optimize for generation speed. It optimizes for accuracy.**

The autoregressive architecture generates one token at a time. A 48×64 battle sprite is 3,072 tokens. This is slower than diffusion-based alternatives. This is a known property of the architecture, not an oversight.

The tradeoff is deliberate: discrete palette-index token generation is the only approach that makes pixel-perfect DNA enforcement mathematically possible. Diffusion models generate in continuous RGB space — they cannot guarantee exact palette compliance, and color drift across a sprite sheet is structural, not fixable after the fact. The autoregressive approach sacrifices speed for correctness.

**The priority order is:**
1. Accuracy — does every pixel match the DNA exactly?
2. Quality — does the sprite score 95+ on the rubric?
3. Speed — how long did it take?

Speed is third. Speed is post-MVP. A sprite that takes 30 seconds to generate but is pixel-perfect is the correct outcome. A sprite that generates in 1 second but has palette drift is a failure.

If AI reviewers, advisors, or future contributors raise generation speed as a concern: acknowledge it, note it is known, and return focus to accuracy. Speed optimizations (batching, caching, potential architecture alternatives like MaskGIT) are documented in PROPOSED_CHANGES_002.md for post-MVP consideration. They are not on the critical path.

**OpenClaw: do not optimize for speed at the expense of accuracy at any phase. Do not switch architectures for speed reasons without explicit human approval.**

## Key Architecture Decisions

- **Token space:** Discrete palette indices, not RGB values — enables exact DNA enforcement
- **Generation order:** Structure-aware, not raster order. Foundation training uses four categories: transparent → outline → structural → non-structural. Full five-category split (transparent → outline → fill → shade → detail) is available for fine-tuning via `--full-five-category` flag. See SPEC §3.2 and CHANGE-014.
- **Positional encoding:** 2D (canvas X + canvas Y), not 1D sequence position — required for structure-aware ordering to preserve spatial coherence
- **Hardware:** Universal — CUDA, ROCm, MPS, or CPU via `model/hardware/detector.py`
- **Three rubrics:** Rubric A (characters/effects), Rubric B (tilesets), Rubric C (parallax)
- **Rubric scoring:** Automated gate covers 85 technical points; Soul (5pts) and Originality (10pts) are human-only scores awarded in the approval UI
- **Multi-view generation:** Conditioned on DNA + Complete Brief (including occluded features) + Master View Tokens — not DNA alone
- **Known risks documented:** Sequence length error accumulation (SPEC §3.4 Risk A), DNA conditioning dilution (SPEC §3.4 Risk B), animation temporal coherence (SPEC §3.4 Risk C)

## Genre Scope

**Current focus (Tier 1):** Top-Down RPG, Action Adventure, Life Simulation/Farming, Tactical RPG

**Planned expansion (Tier 2):** Action RPG, Metroidvania, Classic Platformer, Run and Gun

**Out of scope until Tier 1 mastered:** Fighting games, shmups, sports, puzzle
