"""
Mode 3 — Environment & Tileset Generation

CRITICAL RULES FOR THIS MODE:
1. Tiles generated in raster order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom) so neighbor seams exist. [CHANGE-012]
2. Seam context conditioning: left neighbor right edge + upper neighbor bottom row as hard tokens before generation.
3. seam_validator.py on every tile; failed seams trigger rebuild with same seam context + failure note. [CHANGE-012]
4. Automated rubric gate 85/85 (tileset rubric) before human sees output.
5. No parallel random tile generation — order is part of the spec.

See SPEC §5.3. Phase 0 stub.
