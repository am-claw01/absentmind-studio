"""
Mode 7 — Freeform Generation

CRITICAL RULES FOR THIS MODE:
1. No DNA conditioning, no style bible, full 256-color vocabulary — Constitution Rule 2 still holds:
   generation is discrete palette-index tokens via the same autoregressive engine; no diffusion/RGB pipelines. [SPEC §5.7]
2. Outputs go to freeform/ only — never continuity manifest, never project DNA. [SPEC §5.7]
3. Lighter quality check than 95 combined — but still no obvious technical garbage; log to freeform_log.md.
4. Prompt expansion (Mode 5b) is NOT used here.
5. Do not promote freeform PNGs to project assets without full Mode 1 + DNA flow.

See SPEC §5.7. Phase 0 stub.
