# AM Pixel Bible — Document Changelog
**Absentmind Studio | Version 1.5**

This document is the authoritative change history for every document in the AM Pixel Bible. It was initially compiled retroactively from project conversation history. All future changes must be logged here in real time before being applied to any document.

---

## How To Use This Document

Each section covers one document. Each version entry lists what changed and why. When making future changes, add an entry here first — it forces clarity about what is changing and creates an audit trail that keeps all documents synchronized.

**Version convention:**
- v1.0 — Initial creation
- v1.1 — First major revision (freeform + web UI gap closure)
- v1.2 — Second major revision (PROPOSED_CHANGES_001 implementation)
- v1.3 — Third major revision (PROPOSED_CHANGES_002 implementation)
- v1.4 — Fourth alignment revision: canonical tree after `bible-v1.3-apr13` distinguished per Document Hygiene Rules (all documents incremented together; no additional CHANGE series delta)
- v1.5 — Fifth revision (**PROPOSED_CHANGES_003**): CONSTITUTION.md; compliance gates + emergency halt; session_log / decision_log; Startup Protocol (Rule 11); Hardware Reality table; DNA rollback procedure; Phase 8 failure-cluster protocol; mode module docstrings; rubric evidence requirement

**Bible-wide version rule:** All documents must share the same version number at the end of any update session. A document that has no content changes in a given session still increments its version to maintain alignment. The exception is ROOT_README.md which tracks separately as the umbrella document.

## ROOT README.md

### v1.0 — Initial Creation
- Created as the repo root overview document
- Defined AM Studio umbrella brand (AM Pixel + AM Audio)
- Listed AM Pixel feature set (modes 1–5 at the time)
- Defined repository structure with links to spec documents
- Established "Absentmind Studio" as the brand name (replaced "Pixel Forge AI")
- Status: "Pre-development definition phase"

### v1.1 — Feature Expansion
- AM Pixel feature list expanded to include Mode 6 (battle effects), Mode 7 (freeform), parallax generation, and Web UI
- AM Audio description updated: explicitly marked as "planned post-AM Pixel v1 — not in current scope"
- Repository structure updated to reflect new `ui/` directory and `mode7_freeform.py`
- Status updated to: "AM Pixel Bible complete and gap-free v1.1"

### v1.2 — Status Correction & Changelog
- Status section rewritten: removed "gap-free" language — replaced with living document framing acknowledging ongoing refinement
- Version reference updated from v1.1 to v1.2
- Changelog section added (CHANGE-018)
- Reason: "gap-free" was inaccurate and set wrong expectations; a living spec will always have discoverable gaps

### v1.3 — Status alignment & repo root README (2026-04-19)
- Status section updated: AM Pixel Bible documents at **v1.3** (SPEC, ROADMAP, FOLDER_STRUCTURE, OPENCLAW_PROMPT, GENRE_TAXONOMY, `am-pixel/README.md` hub); references **PROPOSED_CHANGES_001** (archived) and **PROPOSED_CHANGES_002** (staging)
- Repo root `README.md` (`absentmind-studio/`) added as the canonical umbrella document (same content as historical `README-absentmind-studio.md` bundles)
- Reason: Status text had drifted (still referenced v1.2 while the Bible was at v1.3)

### v1.4 — Bible-wide version increment (2026-04-19)
- AM Pixel Bible incremented to **v1.4** per Document Hygiene Rules: the canonical post-`bible-v1.3-apr13` revision is no longer co-numbered as v1.3; Status and all `am-pixel` document headers/footers updated; archive folder **`bible-v1.3-latest`** renamed **`bible-v1.4`**

## am-pixel/SPEC.md

### v1.0 — Initial Creation
- Product definition: custom autoregressive transformer generating palette-index tokens
- Quality standard: 95/100 individual threshold, 99/100 production threshold (NOTE: threshold definition was ambiguous at this version — fixed in v1.1)
- Core architecture: transformer decoder, DNA conditioning via prefix tokens, CUDA-only hardware requirement
- Character DNA system: full schema, lock warning, extraction process
- Generation modes 1–5: character creation, sheet extension, tileset/environment, UI, font
- Single evaluation rubric covering all asset types
- Project organization: tab structure, GitHub integration, multi-project DNA
- Continuity enforcement: three checks, continuity manifest
- Self-training layer: boot training, practice gauntlet, continuous protocol
- Style modes: SNES default, hardware constraint toggle, future expansion path
- Export formats: Godot, RPG Maker MZ, GameMaker, Unity, generic JSON
- Deployment: local mode, server mode, freemium tiers
- Technical stack: CUDA-only

### Between v1.0 and v1.1 — Threshold Fix
- Added ⚠️ CRITICAL DEFINITION callout box to Section 2 explicitly distinguishing:
  - 95/100 = individual sprite SCORE (points earned)
  - 99/100 = batch PASS RATE (99 sprites out of 100 each independently scoring 95+)
- Added concrete pass/fail examples to prevent misinterpretation
- Reason: Both Claude and Gemini misread the threshold as a point score of 99 in independent evaluations

### Between v1.0 and v1.1 — Gap Analysis Updates
- Mode 1: Added portrait profile (48×48–64×64, expression variants, max 4 unique detail colors)
- Mode 1: Added large-format/multi-tile boss mode (multi-tile composition, sync animation, tile grid manifest)
- Mode 3: Renamed to "Environment, Tileset & Parallax Generation"
- Mode 3: Added Tileset Anchor system (locked seed tiles governing all subsequent tile generation)
- Mode 3: Added seam validation requirement (all four edges, seamless tiling mandatory)
- Mode 3: Added transition tiles as explicit required tile type
- Mode 3: Added world map location markers (town, dungeon, castle, port, cave, airship icons)
- Mode 3b: Added full parallax background spec — layer stack (sky/far/mid/foreground), Parallax Anchor, layer_compositor.py evaluation, character contrast check
- Mode 4: Added status condition icons, element icons, item/equipment icon system, world map location markers, title screen
- Mode 6: Added Battle Effect Animations (was previously unnumbered)
- Tab structure: Updated to include Battle Effects, Portrait Art, Location Markers, all icon types, Title Screen
- Evaluation: Replaced single rubric with three rubrics (A: characters, B: tilesets, C: parallax)
- Tooling: Added seam_validator, tileset_anchor_extractor, layer_compositor, effect_timing_evaluator, icon_grammar_checker

### v1.1 — Freeform & Web UI
- Product definition updated to include freeform capability
- Section 3.3: Added Freeform Engine and Web UI as first-class system components
- Section 3.1: Added Mode 7 freeform bypass note (no DNA conditioning, full 256-color vocabulary)
- Section 4.3: DNA Lock Warning scoped to Modes 1–6 only — Mode 7 explicitly non-DNA
- Mode 7 Freeform added (Section 5.7) — full spec including output isolation, quality check, resolution limits, promotion restriction
- Section 14 Web UI added — chat panel, 1×/4× preview, approve/reject/adjust, project tabs, freeform tab, continuity manifest viewer, hardware status bar, FastAPI + HTML/JS localhost only
- Technical stack updated with cloud GPU fallback note and FastAPI web UI
- Version bumped to 1.1

### v1.2 — PROPOSED_CHANGES_001 Implementation
- CHANGE-004: Restored missing `## 6. Project Organization` header (subsections 6.1–6.3 were orphaned)
- CHANGE-004: Renumbered — Web UI moved from §14 to §13, Technical Stack from §15 to §14 (no gap)
- CHANGE-003: §3.1 hardware — removed "NVIDIA GPU with CUDA, minimum 10GB VRAM", replaced with reference to detection hierarchy
- CHANGE-003: §14 Technical Stack rewritten with full detection hierarchy (NVIDIA→CUDA, AMD→ROCm, MPS, OpenCL, CPU) plus cloud GPU rental note
- CHANGE-001 + REFINEMENT-001A: §3.2 — structure-aware token ordering added (five categories: transparent first, then outline, fill, shade, detail last); positional encodings preserve (x,y); Phase 4 comparison experiment required; category distribution logging required with 3% floor
- CHANGE-007 (Risk A): §3.4 — sequence length error accumulation documented; Phase 4 gate if >1,500 token pass rate < 70%; hierarchical generation upgrade path
- CHANGE-008 (Risk B): §3.4 — DNA conditioning dilution at long sequences; Phase 4 top/bottom half measurement; cross-attention upgrade path if delta > 10%
- CHANGE-009 (Risk C): §3.4 — animation temporal coherence gap; Phase 7–8 evaluation gate; temporal conditioning upgrade path
- CHANGE-002 + REFINEMENT-002A: §5.5b — Prompt Expansion Layer added (LLM API call, SNES guardrails, always editable, freeform excluded, Phase 7 build)
- §3.3 Approval Pipeline row updated to note prompt expansion capability
- Footer updated to v1.2

### v1.3 — PROPOSED_CHANGES_002 Implementation
- CHANGE-010: §3.1 — 2D positional encoding requirement added; 1D encodings incompatible with structure-aware ordering because they encode sequence distance not canvas proximity; each token gets learned X + Y coordinate embeddings summed at input layer
- CHANGE-011: §3.4 — MaskGIT documented as Phase 4 optional speed experiment only if batch generation is a demonstrated practical blocker; not a pre-Phase-0 decision; speed is explicitly not a primary concern
- CHANGE-012: §5.3 — Sliding window boundary conditioning added for tileset generation; right edge of left neighbor + bottom row of upper neighbor prepended as hard conditioning tokens; tileset generation must proceed in raster order; failed seams include failure annotation in rebuild prompt
- CHANGE-013 + REFINEMENT-013A: §8.2/§8.3 — Rubric A restructured into two tiers: automated gate (85 points, hard math) and human gate (15 points, aesthetic judgment); Soul/Originality moved to human-only scoring in approval UI; context-aware Soul scoring — foreground characters scored on distinctiveness, background characters scored on visual recession (renamed "Visual Hierarchy") to support intentional visual hierarchy design
- CHANGE-014: §3.2 — Pixel classifier simplified to four categories for foundation training (transparent, outline, structural, non-structural); shade/detail boundary semantically ambiguous in scraped data; full five-category classification reserved for fine-tuning set via `--full-five-category` flag
- CHANGE-015: §3.4 Risk C — Skeletal pose tokens added as secondary animation upgrade path supplement; rule-based 2D skeleton extraction (~10–12 key points); conditions Frame 2 on positional deltas not raw pixel tokens; only build if raw-token temporal conditioning fails; pose_extractor.py stub initialized Phase 0
- CHANGE-016: §4.1, §4.2, §4.3, §4.4, §5.1 — Brief elevated from flavor text to required feature inventory; `occluded_features` array field added to DNA schema; DNA lock warning updated to prompt for hidden feature completeness; DNA extraction process prompts for occluded features before lock; Mode 1 non-master profile generation updated to twin input: `[DNA] + [Complete Brief including occluded_features] + [Master View Tokens]`
- CHANGE-017: §3.2 — Paired-view training sequences added; view_pair_detector.py and pair_annotator.py added to pipeline; minimum 20% paired-view examples target; synthetic pairs (reflections) permitted at lower training weight; teaches model rotation geometry implicitly
- CHANGE-018: Changelog sections added to all Bible documents
- CHANGE-019: §3.2 — Two-tier corpus strategy documented (Tier 1 = Golden Dataset 3,000–5,000 manually curated sprites; Tier 2 = broad scraped corpus 30,000–50,000); training strategy: pre-train on Tier 2, fine-tune on Tier 1; Phase 3 time allocation 3× original estimate warning
- CHANGE-021: §8.4 — vlm_critic.py added as upgrade-path-only tool; supplements deterministic tools for contextually ambiguous criteria (banding vs cylindrical shading, black robe outlines); only invoked on borderline failures; stub initialized Phase 0
- CHANGE-022: §16 Post-MVP Architecture Evolution added — component compositing documented as future direction; flat generation ships first; triggers if brief-conditioned multi-view proves insufficient after Genre 1A; COMPONENT_COMPOSITING_NOTES.md stub initialized Phase 0
- CHANGE-023: §15 Training Data Provenance added — TRAINING_PROVENANCE_MANIFEST.json as immutable legal ledger; legal rationale (deletion does not retroactively legalize training; model weights are evidence; spoliation of evidence risk; EU AI Act compliance); acceptable license types defined; retention policy (never delete)
- Fixed duplicate training data sourcing priority section in §3.2
- **Path audit corrections (cross-reference QA):** §5.7 freeform output path corrected `assets/freeform/` → `freeform/` (root-level per FOLDER_STRUCTURE). §4.4 and §5.2 corrected `CHARACTER_DNA/` → `dna/characters/`. §5.2 corrected `SHEET_LAYOUT/` → `sheets/`. §3.2 stale cross-reference corrected to `§15 Training Data Provenance`. Mode 6 `### 5.6` header restored — content existed without section heading. Duplicate DNA schema block removed from §4.2.
- Version bumped to 1.3

## Document Hygiene Rules (Going Forward)

1. Every change to any Bible document gets an entry in this file first
2. Changelog entries must specify: what changed, which document and section, and why
3. Version numbers increment on every edit session — no silent changes
4. All Bible documents must share the same version number after any update session (ROOT README tracks separately as the umbrella document)
5. The PROPOSED_CHANGES staging document pattern works well — use it for future batches before committing to the Bible
6. When an external AI evaluates the Bible, log the evaluation source and any accepted changes here
7. Never update a single document in isolation — always check for cross-reference impacts and update all affected documents in the same pass
8. PROPOSED_CHANGES documents are archived (not deleted) once fully implemented
