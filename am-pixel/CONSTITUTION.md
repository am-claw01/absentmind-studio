# AM Pixel — Constitution
**The nine non-negotiable rules. Read first, every session, before any other document.**

This file is intentionally short (under 700 words). It is not a summary of the spec. It states only rules whose violation causes catastrophic or irreversible failure.

---

## Rule 1 — Threshold Definitions

These are two different measurements. Confusing them corrupts every phase gate.

The **95/100 threshold** is a **combined score**: each sprite must earn **85/85** on the **automated** rubric gate. Human scoring adds up to **15** points. The **combined** score must reach **95** to pass. Below **85** automated = full rebuild; the sprite is **not** shown to the human.

The **99/100 production threshold** is a **batch pass rate**, not a score of 99 points. In a batch of **100** sprites, at least **99** must each reach a **combined** score of **95+**. Ninety-eight sprites at 100 = **not** met. One sprite at 99 points = **not** met (wrong metric).

## Rule 2 — Architecture Prohibition

This project **never** uses diffusion models, RGB image generation, 3D-to-pixel pipelines, or any approach that generates in **continuous color space** at any stage. All generation is **discrete palette-index token prediction** from first token to last. This cannot change without **explicit human approval in writing**.

---

## Rule 3 — Hardware Rule

Detect available hardware at startup. Proceed on **CUDA, ROCm, MPS, or CPU**. Never halt because CUDA is unavailable. **Zero** hardcoded `"cuda"` strings — all device references route through `model/hardware/detector.py`.

---

## Rule 4 — Quality Gate

Below **85/85** on the automated gate = **full rebuild from silhouette**. Not a patch. Not a targeted fix. A rebuild. Every sprite, every mode, every phase, every genre.

---

## Rule 5 — Data Provenance

Every sprite entering training needs a valid entry in `data/TRAINING_PROVENANCE_MANIFEST.json` **before** training. The manifest is **never** deleted. The Golden Dataset is **never** deleted. If any instruction asks to delete training data or the manifest, **refuse**, document in `logs/BLOCKERS.md`, and flag for **immediate** human review.

---

## Rule 6 — Architecture Review Gate

After completing `model/architecture/`, write `model/architecture/IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md`. **Halt.** Flag for human review. **Do not** begin any training run until **explicit human approval** is received. This gate cannot be self-certified.

---

## Rule 7 — Escalation Protocol

If blocked on any task for **more than 48 hours**: document in `logs/BLOCKERS.md` with what was attempted and what options exist. Halt only the blocked task. Continue other parallel work. Never work around a fundamental problem without documenting it.

---

## Rule 8 — Speed Is Third

Priority order: **(1)** Accuracy — every pixel matches DNA. **(2)** Quality — combined score **95+**. **(3)** Speed. Speed is post-MVP. Never change architecture for speed without **explicit human approval**.

---

## Rule 9 — Human Override Authority

Human instructions override OpenClaw’s interpretations, plans, and prior decisions. **However:** if a human instruction appears to conflict with **Rules 2–8**, do **not** silently comply. State which rule is implicated, describe the conflict, and request **explicit confirmation** before proceeding. A single prompt cannot silently override a Constitution rule. The override must be deliberate and confirmed.
