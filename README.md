# Absentmind Studio (AM Studio)

> AI-powered retro game asset generation for solo developers and indie teams.

---

## What Is AM Studio

AM Studio is a suite of AI tools that gives solo game developers a complete art and audio department — no artistic skill required. Every tool in the suite is purpose-built for retro game aesthetics, producing original, studio-quality assets through natural language conversation.

AM Studio is not a wrapper around existing image generators. It is a custom-built AI pipeline with purpose-designed model architecture, character DNA enforcement, and a self-improving training loop. The output is indistinguishable from human-produced retro game art.

## The Suite

### AM Pixel *(active development)*
AI sprite generator and game asset manager for retro pixel art games.

- Text-to-sprite generation with iterative natural language approval
- Character DNA system for pixel-perfect cross-sprite continuity
- Full sprite sheet management (non-destructive extension)
- Environment tileset generation with aesthetic proof workflow
- Parallax battle background generation with layer system
- Battle effect animation generation (Mode 6)
- UI, font, and animated tile generation
- **Freeform generation (Mode 7)** — any custom pixel art image, any resolution, no project constraints
- Full local web UI — chat, preview, approve/reject, project tabs, freeform tab
- GitHub project integration and asset versioning
- Export for Godot, RPG Maker MZ, GameMaker, and generic JSON

### AM Audio *(planned — post AM Pixel v1)*
AI chiptune composer and sound effects studio for retro game audio.
Planned as a companion to AM Pixel under the AM Studio umbrella. Not in current scope — development begins after AM Pixel reaches production threshold.

---

## Target User

Solo indie developers building retro-style games who have no art or audio skills and cannot afford a dedicated artist or composer. AM Studio removes the asset creation bottleneck entirely, replacing it with a natural language conversation.

## Brand

**Absentmind Studio** is the umbrella brand.
**AM Pixel** and **AM Audio** are the products.
The short form **AM Studio** is the everyday reference.

## Status

AM Pixel Bible documents are at **v1.5** (`CONSTITUTION`, `SPEC`, `ROADMAP`, `FOLDER_STRUCTURE`, `OPENCLAW_PROMPT`, `GENRE_TAXONOMY`, `am-pixel/README.md`). **PROPOSED_CHANGES_001** and **Series 002** are merged into the Bible (archives retained). **PROPOSED_CHANGES_003** (drift prevention, compliance gates, session logs) is merged into v1.5; the file remains as a proposal archive. OpenClaw should begin from `am-pixel/CONSTITUTION.md`, then `am-pixel/OPENCLAW_PROMPT.md`. This remains a living document set.
